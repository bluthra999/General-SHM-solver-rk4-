To write the differential equation (DE) in terms of $$ f(x) $$, $$ g(x) $$, and $$ h(x) $$, we need to analyze the components of the LCR circuit equation:

### General LCR Circuit Differential Equation
The governing equation for an LCR circuit is:

$$
L \frac{d^2q}{dt^2} + R \frac{dq}{dt} + \frac{1}{C} q = V(t)
$$

Here:
- $$ L \frac{d^2q}{dt^2} $$: Represents the **inertial force** (inductance term).
- $$ R \frac{dq}{dt} $$: Represents the **damping force** (resistance term).
- $$ \frac{1}{C} q $$: Represents the **restoring force** (capacitive term).
- $$ V(t) $$: Represents the **external driving force** (voltage source).

In terms of the solutions $$ f(x) $$, $$ g(x) $$, and $$ h(x) $$, we interpret these components as follows:

### Components in Terms of $$ f(x) $$, $$ g(x) $$, and $$ h(x) $$
1. **Natural Oscillation (Restoring Force)**:
   - The natural frequency of oscillation is determined by the undamped angular frequency:
     $$
     \omega_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}
     $$
   - This corresponds to the natural oscillatory solution, which is part of $$ f(x) $$. When there is no damping ($$ R = 0 $$) and no external force ($$ V(t) = 0 $$), the solution is purely oscillatory:
     $$
     q(t) = A \cos(\omega_0 t + \phi)
     $$

2. **Damping Force**:
   - The damping term, proportional to $$ R/L $$, introduces an exponential decay factor into the solution. This modifies the natural oscillation frequency to a damped frequency:
     $$
     q(t) = A e^{-\alpha t} \cos(\omega_d t + \phi)
     $$
   - Here, $$ f(x) = A e^{-\alpha x} \cos(\omega_d x) $$, where:
     - $$ \alpha = R / (2L) $$: Damping coefficient.
     - $$ \omega_d = \sqrt{\omega_0^2 - \alpha^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{LC} - (R/2L)^2} $$: Damped angular frequency.

3. **External Driving Force**:
   - If there is an external voltage source, it acts as a driving force. For example, if $$ V(t) = V_0 e^{-\beta t} $$, it could correspond to a term like $$ h(x) = A e^{-\beta x} $$. In your case, if there is no explicit time-dependent voltage source, this term can be ignored.

4. **Additional Terms (Phase Shift or Modified Decay)**:
   - The function $$ g(x) = A e^{-\alpha x / 2} \cos(\omega_d x + c) $$ could represent a modified oscillation with slower decay or a phase shift.
   - The function $$ h(x) = A e^{-\alpha x / 3} $$ represents pure exponential decay without oscillations.

### Writing the DE in Terms of $$ f(x), g(x), h(x) $$
Using the above definitions, we can write:

$$
L f''(x) + R f'(x) + C^{-1} f(x) = 0
$$

Where:
- **Restoring Force**: The term involving $$ C^{-1} f(x) = (1/C) f(x) $$.
- **Damping Force**: The term involving $$ R f'(x)/L = (\text{damping coefficient}) f'(x) $$.
- **External Force**: If present, would be represented by a term like $$ h(x) = V(t)/L$$.

If you want to include all three functions in a combined system, you could write:

$$
L g''(x) + R g'(x/2) + C^{-1} g(x/2 + c_1)=
